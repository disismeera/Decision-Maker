The "decision_maker" function starts by printing a welcome message and asking the user to enter their "choices" separated by commas. 
The user's input is stored in the choices variable as a list, using the input().split(",") method.

Next, the "random" library is imported and used to make a random decision from the list of choices stored in the "choices" variable. 
The "random.choice" method is used to randomly select an item from the list.

Finally, the decision made by the program is printed to the screen using the "print" function.
